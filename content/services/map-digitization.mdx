This is a process of converting the geographic features on an analog map into digital format using a digitizing tablet, or digitizer, which is connected to a computer. Features on a paper map are traced with a digitizer puck, a device similar to a mouse, and the x,y coordinates of these features are automatically recorded and stored as spatial data.

Since the establishment of the company map digitization has been our major expertise. The process uses geo-referenced scanned analog map or digital orthophoto as a background, from which a vector map is prepared by directly tracing map features on it. All of our outputs support a range of industry standards ready for client workstation loading. We use various GIS softwares for this purpose which include Nigmas, AutoCad, ArcGIS, MicroStation etc.
